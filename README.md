# chat

Thanks for stopping by! This chat is an example of using the MERN stack. 
Right now I'm using this for myself. That means you'll probably see poor programming practices so don't do this at home! :)

## What is MERN?
M - MongoDB
E - Expressjs
R - Reactjs
N - Nodejs

`Because who needs anything other than JavaScript?`

## Initial goals (I'm mostly writing this for myself so I have a list of things I know I want to do!)
1. UserA should be able to send messages to UserB (this includes UserB actually receiving the message!)
2. The message should be stored in MongoDB (securely? Maybe not at first so I don't bog myself down on scope...)
3. Chatrooms?
4. Authentication??
5. EMOJIS???
